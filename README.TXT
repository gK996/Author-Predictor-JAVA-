This program works by predicting wether quotations are likely to have been written by one author or another.
Based on a statistical model of the kind of language used by each author, a new piece of text is analysed by measuring how well it fits the statistical models,
thus selecting the one that gives the best fit.
This program consists of 3 main classes and one helper class.
Tests are also provided to test the correctness of each of the classes (By lecturer).
BlueJ IDE was used to write this program.
